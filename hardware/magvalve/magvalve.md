# magvalve
## an electrically controllable expiration and overpressure valve

During inhalation the pressure in the airway must not exceed a 
limit which in case of ARDS patients is in the range of 25..35 mbar (cm H2O)

During exhalation the pressure in the airway is expected to sink to 10..15 
mbar, the so-called PEEP (Positive End-Exspiratory Pressure).

The magvalve was designed to fulfil both jobs, security against overpressure 
during inhalation and controlled exhalation to PEEP.

The magvalve consists of a box where the exhalation tube is connected to, 
with a round hole, 43 mm diameter, in the top. In the axis of the hole a 
sliding guide is attached at the bottom of the box.

The lid consists of two round plastic sheets with a round silicone sheet 
in between. All 3 are axially mounted on a metal pin which slides in the 
guide mentioned above. when the pin is inserted into the guide the lid 
slides down until the silicone sheet reaches the rim of the hole, sealing it.

Against the top of the metal pin pushes a pushing solenoid, here we
used a __LEDEX STA 26X52 28 PS__ which is energized from a adjustable 
power source controlled by the controller.

When the force exerted by the pressure in the box (pressure x area of 
the hole) exceeds weight of both lid and solenoid anchor plus the 
magnetic force of the solenoid, the lid rises and air exits alang the 
rim of the hole.
