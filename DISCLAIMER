The plans, documents and other materials (“Material”) contained on this 
website are intended to facilitate the design of a prototype reproducible 
medical device to be used if required during the Covid-19 pandemic. The 
Material is not itself a medical device. The Material has not been tested 
and has not been approved for use in humans or animals by any regulatory 
authority of any country.

By using the Material, you are agreeing to the following disclaimer. 
build-a-vent.org offers the Material as-is and as-available, and makes 
no representations or warranties of any kind whatever concerning the 
Material, whether express, implied, statutory, or other. This includes, 
without limitation, warranties of merchantability, fitness for a particular 
purpose, non-infringement, absence of latent or other defects, accuracy, 
or the presence or absence of errors, whether or not known or discoverable.

To the extent possible, in no event will build-a-vent.org be liable to you 
on any legal theory (including, without limitation, negligence) or otherwise 
for any direct, special, indirect, incidental, consequential, punitive, 
exemplary, or other losses, costs, expenses, or damages arising out of the 
Material or use of the Material, even if build-a-vent.org has been advised 
of the possibility of such losses, costs, expenses, or damages.

Any ventilator system that has not been approved by a competent medical 
device regulatory authority may not deliver to the user the ability to 
properly monitor and control tidal volume, inspiratory pressure, 
inspiratory:expiratory ratio, heart rate, nor provide the user with the 
ability to monitor and control positive-end expiratory pressure (PEEP), 
peak inspiratory pressure (PIP) or to adapt to individual patient 
requirements. Inability to monitor and/or control any of these factors 
can cause death or serious permanent injury.

The disclaimer of warranties and limitation of liability provided above 
shall be interpreted in a manner that, to the extent possible, most closely 
approximates an absolute disclaimer and waiver of all liability.
